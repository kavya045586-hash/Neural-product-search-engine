## 🌟 Key Features
* **Semantic Retrieval:** Goes beyond keyword matching to understand the "meaning" of queries (e.g., searching for "camera" returns GoPro mounts and lens accessories).
* **Two-Tower Architecture:** Implements separate User and Item towers for scalable, low-latency inference.
* **Fast Similarity Search:** Uses normalized embeddings and dot-product calculations to rank 48,000+ items in milliseconds.
* **Real-time Interface:** A clean, responsive web UI for interactive product discovery.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The core of this project is a **Two-Tower Neural Network** built with TensorFlow/Keras. 
- **Item Tower:** Processes categorical data (Brand, Category) and textual data (Product Titles) into a 64-dimensional embedding space.
- **User Tower:** Learns user preferences and maps them into the same shared vector space.
- **Inference:** Recommendations are generated by finding the nearest neighbors in the embedding space using cosine similarity.

## 📊 Evaluation Results
* **Hit Rate@10:** 17.40%
* **Category Separation Score:** 0.0714 (Indicates successful semantic clustering)
* **Average Category Diversity:** 0.70
* **Total Items Processed:** 48,629

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Engineering:** Pandas, NumPy, Parquet
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, t-SNE
